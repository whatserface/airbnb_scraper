Great location for seeing the sites of Prague, visiting the Christmas Markets, shopping and enjoying the delicious restaurants all within walking distance to the apartment.  The rental team were extremely responsive to any questions I had prior to arrival, including arranging transportation back to Munich.  They also have compiled a wonderful Prague guide which was great to share with the rest of my family prior to visiting so we had a plan once we arrived.

The beautiful views from the rooftop gave perspective of the architecture and location of the major places to see - these are easily within walking distance. Ubers are super easy to get to/ from places if pressed for time or don't want to walk 1-2 miles between venues. <br/><br/>We had a group of 8 and the apartment accommodated us well and provided great common space. Toiletries are sparse so do bring your own. The kitchen is well appointed for snacking, drinking and light cooking. The two french presses were VERY handy! The beds are very comfortable and cozy. <br/><br/>We didn't have heat for the first 36+ hours so we were chilly for a bit -  probably not a regular occurrence and eventually things got fixed (owners very communicative). The place is a tad run down with rips in the dining chairs, minor spots on sofa, rips in the hot tub cover so if that bugs you then take note. It didn't bug us at all and were minor.",

The location was just perfect and the view was absolutely amazing with the Prague Castle on one side and the Old Town on the other. The thing we appreciated the most was the jacuzzi on the rooftop. Drinking champagne while laying in hot water and watching the sunset behind the cathedral was one of the most marvelous things we’ve ever experienced. The grill also came in handy. The host recommended a great butcher’s shop nearby and we had a wonderful BBQ.  Our two families had a truly amazing time in Prague, we already miss it. We are definitely coming back soon.

The real gem is the private roof, with a jacuzzi, comfortable outdoor furniture, and an unbeatable view of some of Prague's most iconic landmarks (castle, clock tower, etc.). The location is also great, steps away from Old Town, Charles Bridge, and lots of great restaurants, bars and clubs. The apartment is on a high floor (elevator in building) so noise was never an issue. <br/><br/>The hosts were gracious enough to write up a full Prague guide that our group took full advantage of, including recommendations for restaurants, bars, coffee shops and sites to see. They were very responsive to any questions / concerns I had before we booked, and were great to deal with. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone. It truly made our experience in Prague special, and made it really convenient to tour the city. Many in my group noted that this was the best Airbnb they've every stayed in (especially because of the rooftop!). We'll be back! ",

We were only there a short period of time so tried fitting in as much as possible. We had a little issue with the electrical because the power kept shorting out but after a quick phone call we were told maintenance would fix. I think this may have had something to do with the jacuzzi because as we tried to heat it the power would always cut out. We could not use it because of this. Was definitely a disappointment. One of my guests had fallen over onto a table in the loft and broke it. I had called the owner straight away to arrange a cash payment for the damages. 2 days later I received a message saying the owner had found a broken light and wanted to seek damages. We did not break the light so I told them we would not pay. I haven't had any further contact from the owner. ",

Then the owners immediately asked if it was advertised, only social media was okay. I didn't mean directly, but since social media is always advertising in theory, they should tell me what the conditions would be if we were talking about advertising. Suddenly, there was no response. I asked again the day after and yet nothing came. We had then thought because of the 'ok' to social media and no further answer that it would probably be okay. Then ONE day before arrival (after we had planned a trip for 11 people from Aachen to Prague and had rented two more locations for the same purpose without any problems in Prague) Jana wrote to me that they would now want to class it as an advertisement and that it would then cost the FOUR TIMES the price. After I told her that this was not possible, as she would have had to communicate this much earlier and it would have incredible follow-up costs for us to cancel now, she probably talked to the owner of the location and said it would only cost '200 euros more. I find this kind of impossible and tricky.<br/><br/>About the apartment itself: Location is great and on the roof terrace you can tolerate it well. Still, I think the location is rather dirty for the price. We were in Praha 4 the night before in an apartment which was only 300 euros more expensive and this was one of the most crass and beautiful apartments we have ever seen. This made this location seem all the more run-down and, above all, much darker than shown in the photos. So if you don't care about money and who just wants to live centrally, you can take the apartment. But if you are looking for an exceptional location for your stay that is absolutely worth its price, I advise against this location.",
