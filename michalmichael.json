The location was absolutely perfect, right in the heart of the city and close to all the major attractions.<br/><br/>The highlight of the trip was definitely the rooftop Jacuzzi with an amazing view. It was the perfect spot to unwind after a long day of exploring and provided a truly unique experience. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, and well-equipped with all the amenities we needed for our stay.<br/><br/>Overall, we had a fantastic time at this Airbnb and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and convenient place to stay in Prague.

Great location for seeing the sites of Prague, visiting the Christmas Markets, shopping and enjoying the delicious restaurants all within walking distance to the apartment.  The rental team were extremely responsive to any questions I had prior to arrival, including arranging transportation back to Munich.  They also have compiled a wonderful Prague guide which was great to share with the rest of my family prior to visiting so we had a plan once we arrived.    Michal&Michael's team were great to work with!!",

The beautiful views from the rooftop gave perspective of the architecture and location of the major places to see - these are easily within walking distance. Ubers are super easy to get to/ from places if pressed for time or don't want to walk 1-2 miles between venues. <br/><br/>We had a group of 8 and the apartment accommodated us well and provided great common space. Toiletries are sparse so do bring your own. The kitchen is well appointed for snacking, drinking and light cooking. The two french presses were VERY handy! The beds are very comfortable and cozy. <br/><br/>We didn't have heat for the first 36+ hours so we were chilly for a bit -  probably not a regular occurrence and eventually things got fixed (owners very communicative). The place is a tad run down with rips in the dining chairs, minor spots on sofa, rips in the hot tub cover so if that bugs you then take note. It didn't bug us at all and were minor.",

It was very hot when we visited Prague, and we really appreciated the air conditioning and fans to keep us cool inside. At night, it was very relaxing to sit in the hot tub overlooking Prague castle after a long day of walking around. Hosts were also very responsive by message when we had questions before and during our stay. We'd definitely stay here again.",

The location is also great, steps away from Old Town, Charles Bridge, and lots of great restaurants, bars and clubs. The apartment is on a high floor (elevator in building) so noise was never an issue. <br/><br/>The hosts were gracious enough to write up a full Prague guide that our group took full advantage of, including recommendations for restaurants, bars, coffee shops and sites to see. They were very responsive to any questions / concerns I had before we booked, and were great to deal with. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone.

We were only there a short period of time so tried fitting in as much as possible. We had a little issue with the electrical because the power kept shorting out but after a quick phone call we were told maintenance would fix. I think this may have had something to do with the jacuzzi because as we tried to heat it the power would always cut out. We could not use it because of this. Was definitely a disappointment. One of my guests had fallen over onto a table in the loft and broke it. I had called the owner straight away to arrange a cash payment for the damages. 2 days later I received a message saying the owner had found a broken light and wanted to seek damages. We did not break the light so I told them we would not pay. I haven't had any further contact from the owner. ",

We were able to check in early and that was very nice and flexible due to our early flight<br/>The space was clean and we could really appreciate the Christmas tree and holiday decorations. <br/>It is quiet in the house, the beds are good and the PS 5 has been fully used by the youth. <br/>The roof terrace is a great extra with the jacuzzi which is wonderfully warm and clean. <br/>Fortunately, the building has an elevator, because otherwise it would be a lot of stairs up and down, as the house is on the 4th floor. <br/><br/>So all in all a very good experience and we felt very much at home. <br/><br/>2 tips I would like to give hosts for an extra good guest experience; <br/>1. Provide a decent espresso machine, that coffee pot is not worthy of the apartment.<br/>2. Provide a welcome package, with e.g. some fruit, a bottle of wine or some beer in the fridge for everyone. Of course, this is much more pleasant to enter and then it feels even more complete.",

We are truly happy that you enjoyed the location of the apartment and that the communication with us reached your satisfaction levels :) \r<br/>Unfortunately, there were extremely heavy rains during your stay in \r<br/>Prague which is not usual. The apartment is located in a very historical building and the older roof could not hold the huge amount of water. We immediately addressed the building manager and are working on the repairs now. We are really sorry that the surveillance camera disturbed you. It is located in the rooftop area for only security reasons-so that we can protect our guests if there is any problem. It’s not meant to disturb your privacy, it’s meant for emergency situations only. The price of the apartment unfolds from apartments location, view and the fact that is located in very unique and historical building as mentioned above. Also the location is very central and you can see all the important monuments from the terrace and you can enjoy the views from the jacuzzi. You simply won’t find another apartment like this in Prague. We hope that besides the things mentioned you really enjoyed your stay in Prague! It was our pleasure to host you! :)",

When it comes to the duvets, there are always 2 single duvets on each double bed. One is just folded over the other one, so you perhaps did not notice but kindly asking next time is best to call/text and we will solve everything our guest need :) Water in the jacuzzi - Due to the covid pandemic, the legal standards for the dosing of disinfectants in the Czech Republic have been changed and it’s possible that the higher dosing caused a slight turbidity. Thank you for your suggestion, we will inspect it further and see if the dosage can be reduced somehow. Im sorry for 1,000 euros fine for climbing on the roof. It may seem crazy to you, but in reality it actually happened, three times!!! The guests climbed on the roof and damaged the roof tiles and roof layers under it, each of these repairs cost 3,000 euros. In addition, the repairs are very complicated, as it is a historical building. We was expecting that our guests will STAY on 100 sq.m. (1000 sq.ft) but our experience showed us that this rules are needed. So we are trying to prevent this and protect our apartment as much as possible, which we hope is understandable. Anyway, your feedback and comments are highly appreciated and we thank you for all your suggestions. It was our pleasure to host you :)",

However, some pieces of furniture are in great need of renovation or urgently need to be renewed. Cleanliness is definitely expandable. In addition, we had no water at least 1 hour every day. In the kitchen there is no coffee maker and no basic equipment such as salt, pepper and oil. The hot tub is extremely chlorine content, so we caught a rash on our body almost all after 3 days.

				"text": "I had requested for a photo shoot for social media right after booking, as I wanted to pay 150 euros cancellation costs rather than not getting the seemingly great apartment. Then the owners immediately asked if it was advertised, only social media was okay. I didn't mean directly, but since social media is always advertising in theory, they should tell me what the conditions would be if we were talking about advertising. Suddenly, there was no response. I asked again the day after and yet nothing came. We had then thought because of the 'ok' to social media and no further answer that it would probably be okay. Then ONE day before arrival (after we had planned a trip for 11 people from Aachen to Prague and had rented two more locations for the same purpose without any problems in Prague) Jana wrote to me that they would now want to class it as an advertisement and that it would then cost the FOUR TIMES the price. After I told her that this was not possible, as she would have had to communicate this much earlier and it would have incredible follow-up costs for us to cancel now, she probably talked to the owner of the location and said it would only cost '200 euros more. I find this kind of impossible and tricky.<br/><br/>About the apartment itself: Location is great and on the roof terrace you can tolerate it well. Still, I think the location is rather dirty for the price. We were in Praha 4 the night before in an apartment which was only 300 euros more expensive and this was one of the most crass and beautiful apartments we have ever seen. This made this location seem all the more run-down and, above all, much darker than shown in the photos. So if you don't care about money and who just wants to live centrally, you can take the apartment. But if you are looking for an exceptional location for your stay that is absolutely worth its price, I advise against this location.",

We found her at the last minute and were pleasantly surprised to see the apartment ,a beautiful view from the balcony. We stayed there for two nights. We arrived by taxi and found a place with ease. We were greeted by the pleasant helpful Veronica and recommended us things to see nearby. There are lovely restaurants literally a few meters away. We have picked this apartment to celebrate our anniversary in the family circle. It was very convenient to get to all tourist places, the weather was wonderful and we spent a lot of time on the balcony with an amazing view of the city. Jakuziis a great addition to the apartment. It has a great view of the castle. We had  a lot of fun. Both young and adult.<br/><br/>The apartment resembles a gallery design with a very thoughtful and accurate layout with interesting big paintings on the walls ,which my mother loved a fan   of Modern Art. The apartment is highly recommended for families. There is a large kitchen salon with all the amenities comfortable bedrooms. Everything is decorated in great taste. We ordered an apartment to celebrate my mother's birthday. It was an amazing vacation, everyone was very happy. A real find!<br/>",
