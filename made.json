Although it costs extra, it is totally worth it to be picked up by him, rather than a random taxi.<br/><br/>WARNING: Please do not forget that this is a treehouse! There will be small insects that naturally come in as a result of its location. They are not bothersome whatsoever, but if a few small bugs inside your space bothers you, you should look elsewhere. The bathroom is not close to that of a hotel’s. Just keep all of the realities that come with such a beautiful outdoors in mind when booking.<br/><br/>Despite this, the AC and the water dispenser work very well making it extremely comfortable. The bed is also very clean and well-kept. <br/><br/>One you are there, the restaurants are a 5-10 minute walk away.

Bailan Beach is anywhere from an hour to two hours from Denpasar, Seminyak, Tabanan, Canggu, and Ubud so plan trips accordingly. There are no shopping centers, malls, Starbucks, or anything of the sort nearby! This is a great stay if you’re looking for something quiet and less touristy! It’s a local, small village experience and I loved every second of it. Great for surfing as well.<br/><br/>Made was a great host that made sure I had everything I needed. His communication was fast and he was there for anything I needed. <br/><br/>I enjoyed a brief walk to local cafes along the beach! It’s only 5 minutes away! If you want an extra fun scenery, please visit the secret cove restaurant! It’s a longer walk than the rest of the restaurants (15 minutes or so) but they served the most DELICIOUS food (the best food I EVER had in Bali) and it was a peaceful walk that was worth it. The staff were so kind and it was nice to be so close by. I  walked along the cove of the beach and it felt secluded and beautiful. Beware along the way there may be dogs (there are many dogs in Bali) that bark at you but they are not aggressive and don’t attack. <br/><br/>If I am in Bailan Beach again, I’m definitely booking here again, hands down.

Check in was easy, and we were exited to see that there was a water purifier in the room for our use. The house and surrounding area were clean, and the landscaping was immaculate.  We ate at Tekor Bali, Casa Balian Cafe, Toms Garden Cafe, Secret Bay, and a small warung on the left side of the road on the way into Balian Beach.

Great coffee, and many fresh, healthy options. Only a 4 minute walk from the treehouse. <br/><br/>Though we don’t surf, we enjoyed sitting out near the beach just to watch. The town is very quiet with many pups roaming around, there was a yoga studio by beach and everyone wears so friendly.",

When we arrived at the treehouse, we were greeted by Made and were shown where to find everything we needed and more in the property.<br/><br/>The bed was extremely comfortable and we both got great sleep. The shower was lovely, and all the linens provided were clean, smelled delightful, and soft to the touch. The property and treehouse were very well kept, clean, and BEAUTIFULLY decorated. There are so many little touches added to the property, and you can see all the hard work that was put into making the treehouse what it is.<br/><br/>The pool was a great place to cool off after a long and hot day in Balian Beach, and the treehouse was just a few minutes walk from the beach and wonderful restaurants. Our favorites were Takor Bali and Sushi Surf, which were both basically right down the road.<br/><br/>We hope to return again and stay at the treehouse again or at one of Made’s other properties.

I have stayed in treehouses before and this is definitely not a treehouse. A better description would be “cabana”. The room was a bit dark and ”rustic”. The grounds did not look like the photos. The photos depict a lush green well maintained space. I understand it is dry season but even considering that the space didn’t seem well maintained. I would have been more satisfied with my experience if I had paid in the $50 a night price range but with a price tag of $100 my expectations were not met.

We literally planned our honeymoon around this stay! And it superseded our expectations!!<br/><br/>We were running late on check in after making our journey from Gilli islands, it was gone 9pm by the time we arrived, but Made was there to help us with our bags and to check us in, he even had suggestions as to the restaurants still open if we hadn’t had dinner (which we hadn’t).<br/><br/>You share a pool with one other of their houses (the glass house, another listing) however we didn’t see one person, whenever we were in pool or on balcony we were (or felt) totally secluded. You can hear the waves from the balcony & will easily lull you to sleep if you let it.<br/><br/>Although we felt like we were the only ones there, when we had found we’d used all the ground coffee they’d supplied, a WhatsApp message to Made meant it was refilled within 5mins!! Also one of the days while enjoying pool, Made walked by and prepared us a coconut to drink that had just fallen from tree! He also made arrangements for our further travel to Ubud after we’d checked out, so if needed they are there to accommodate whatever you need.<br/><br/>All the amenities were there if you wanted to cook, however with their map of bars and restaurants a short walk away you had no reason to! They have a water machine with boiling, room temperature, and ice cold options. Brilliant idea! <br/>The air con was the best we had in Bali by a long way! The bed & pillows were so comfy, and with a soft thin quilt compared to sheets was a nice touch! <br/><br/>The decor is exactly what you see on the listing, bright colourful and quirky. Very in keeping with its surroundings can, the grounds were amazingly well kept, we spent a lot of the time saying to each other “have you seen that plant over there” ahah<br/><br/>I’ve thought really hard to critique this place and cannot for the life of me find one fault or improvement that could be done. <br/><br/>We will be back again ❤️❤️❤️❤️",

She fell asleep and I wanted to enjoy every second so I was going for a midnight swim. <br/><br/>Was more cozy sitting on the bamboo covered sunbed- taking it all in- the sounds, the warm coastal breeze and the strategically placed lights that created a resort feeling gleaming from pool. <br/><br/>Next morning we trekked down to Ocean- about 7 minute walk and passes locals- all with smiles and warm greetings. Some roosters crackling and about half way to the oceanfront there is a little pet monkey that someone owns- it's tied up to a tree so was kinda sad- glad we saw the wild ones later. <br/><br/>The waterfront area is a 7 minute walk-had a few surf shops for rentals, a few different yoga studios, a couple massage places (about $12/hr US), coffee shops and great surf beach. <br/><br/>We got a late check out and enjoyed the \"privacy\" of the pool- even ordered 6 Bintang's from same restaurant that we ate dinner and delivered within minutes and was like $3.00 beer! <br/><br/>We stayed at 7 places in 8 nights and this was one of the best.... we stayed at another Airbnb Ocean Front in Puta, At Double Six in Seminyak, A mansion in Ubud and a resort spot in Nusa Dua on last night. <br/><br/>One night wasn't enough at this place- and the Funky House next door- no one was there but if we had another couple that we could hang with for a week- it would be the perfect place.",

However, it is located on Balian beach which is a ways away from everything else in Bali. (about 2 hour drive from Ubud with traffic, 3-4 hours to airport).

No cellular network No wifi availability didn't bother us much, we used to use Cafe's wifi. <br/><br/>recommendations for travelers: <br/><br/>Do stock up from Alfa Mart or Any market before check-in, if you don't have personal vehicle hired. <br/><br/>The to and fro from Airport or south Bali to Balian will cost you around 10,00,000 IDR of $70. <br/><br/>There are no nearby tourist attractions, all attractions are around 1-2hrs drive. The cab costs around $70 for 2 hrs to and fro drive. The place is in West Bali. <br/><br/>Made is super awesome but he is not available all the time on the property, one has to call him, but without cellular network and wifi network it gets tricky. <br/><br/>the place is romantic & a treasure for couples/family who surf.",

Made truly makes this house a home and is eager to help in any way he can. He goes above and beyond to make sure that your holiday is everything you wished for. His family is equally as lovely and even surprised me with a homemade birthday cake and a present during our stay! <br/><br/>The house itself is clean (within limits of being immersed in plantlife) and offers enough space for relaxing and making the most of the grounds. Made cleaned the Treehouse daily and was available 24/7 for anything we needed. <br/>We will definitely be returning to see Made and his family again, as well as the local driver Putu, whom we highly recommend for day trips and excursions. He was a great driver and humble, offering knowledge and the history of the local attractions and culture. He is well priced and is relaxed too, which for us was exactly what we were looking for when going on a full day trip to Ubud etc. <br/>We did use the cooking facilities in the house, and made use of the night market, which has a small supermarket too for everything you need. A few locals also suggested the warungs there in the evening for food. We loved Tekor Bali (restaurant) and the staff are wonderful- the food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. <br/><br/>We have been home a few days now and are already itching to come back to this wonderful place.

Honestly you need about 6 to get back to airport, just in case there are bus breakdowns in front of you.  Also travel lightly / don't bring a lot of bags.  <br/><br/>Made, Miryam and Gusti (driver) made my stay an absolute pleasure.   VERY close to the beach - I took the roundabout way of waking once, which was also beautiful and only took about 12 min.  However the \"secret\" path to the beach (immediate left as soon as you're on the road from your room) only takes 4-5 min walk as promised.  You are RIGHT near the beach.  <br/><br/>The garden, pool and treehouse were simply stunning.   Really beautiful, peaceful and serene.  They look exactly like the photos.  <br/><br/>There were some ants that found their way into the treehouse however (and I had some food around too which I wrapped up) - they really kept to themselves though and did not even come near the bed.  Really \"polite\" ants (haha) and I'm sure this is nothing that your hosts couldn't take some spray to fully eradicate.   (I didn't want a lot of bug spray so I didn't ask - AND I was able to use the excellent mosquito net to sleep bug-free, even though it wasn't high season for mosquitoes).  VERY helpful. <br/><br/>I've been to India and Costa Rica so I'm familiar with traveling in different countries where you're not going to get the \"Sands Resort\"-style of vacation (sometimes there are bugs / sometimes you have to be careful not to use too much water when you shower [though this was not a problem at the treehouse], and make sure you drink bottled water) - so this place was really beautiful, one of a kind, secluded, private and welcome to me.   They also provided a 5-gallon bottled water installation for drinking in the room.  <br/><br/>The beach was FANTASTIC - the food at the beach was really good - get a fresh coconut with a straw, hang out, surf, it's amazing.",

All questions were quickly answered and their advice was very helpful. The owners also put us in contact with Gusti who drove us around several times during our stay. We were able to make plans and keep in contact with him using Whatsapp which was incredibly helpful. Additionally, the house and property are quite beautiful and are pictured accurately in the listing. The house is just a five minute walk from the beach and we really enjoyed the sleepy, yet tourist friendly town of Balian. <br/><br/>That said, we did experience several issues. During our stay our toilet started leaking and was unusable for several hours (however Made fixed it that day). Additionally, we never had hot water in our shower for the entire trip. I should also note that we rented both houses on the property which we shared with family members. For us, the layout was ideal; but for other travelers the two houses are quite close and I could see lack of privacy being a potential issue. Finally, all travelers should be aware the owners are building another villa next to this one (not noted in listing). During two days of our stay about six men were working on this house during the day, starting at 8 am. We found this frustrating as the construction is not picture or mentioned in the listing and this really diminished the private, serene atmosphere we expected. I highly recommend all travelers check on the status of this construction before booking.<br/><br/>Overall, we did enjoy our time here and the hosts were both friendly and helpful but travelers may want to check on the issues I mentioned.",

The exterior of the villa is true to the listing, charming, cute hut sitting on top of the hill. The room itself felt a bit small and can do with a table/chair for sitting inside at night.\r<br/>\r<br/>The upstairs area is open and non-air conditioned, whilst we didn't use it at night due to mosquitos it is a great look out platform during the day. You can always take the fan from down stairs to up stairs on a hot day. \r<br/>\r<br/>A bit of a draw back is the bathroom/toilet area. Looking back to the listing we've realized that there isn't really a shot of the shower and toilet in the villa and it might have something to do with it is not the most appealing part of the equation - The bathroom area lives in the staircase area of the villa, being an enclosed area with small windows covered by greens it felt a bit damp and could do with better ventilation (Made will be cutting back the green). Whilst we were there we also found that the toilet is a bit crocked and leaking slightly (Myriam suggested that she will be replacing the toilet).\r<br/>\r<br/>The track to the beach/restaurants can get muddy when raining as the area's road isn't really built up but with all the developments that is going on in the area I suspect the roads will be upgraded down the track. The restaurants were great at Balian Beach and we enjoyed breakfast/lunch/dinner there.\r<br/>\r<br/>Whilst we only stayed 2 of the 3 nights booked, through communication I can feel that the Balian Tree house is being managed by a team that cares.  Myriam was quick to respond to my concerns and explained to me things they are doing/will do to address the points, I trust the villa with grow as it receives more and more positive criticism. Made is friendly and is on site from morning until around 4pm. We didn't really need his help with anything and he just worked quietly on the villa next door when we were there. \r<br/>\r<br/>All and all I think it is a great little place to enjoy the nature and sit by the pool during the day. The night life at the near by hotels/restaurants felt lively. If you are not a night thrill seeking person it can feel a bit trapped at night in the room. like everything it is probably a place for everyone but I can definitely see the charms that this little villa brings. \r<br/>\r<br/>",

Friendly Gusti picked us up from the airport and showed us around the house. In the garden we were greeted by a couple of frogs, some snails and a few gecko's. They were soon to become our pets. After a good night's rest we met Made who immediately climbed a tree to get us some fresh coconuts. Many more fruits followed throughout the week. There were two small issues upon arrival and first day, but they were resolved within the hour and Myriam made sure we could relax to the max. We mostly ate at the lovely restaurants in the village or at the night market and I enjoyed a flat white from the coffee stand almost every morning. The food was very enjoyable everywhere and the people are very friendly. Also, the food is not expensive at all, causing me to eat and drink way too much.

Made and two other men were working on an addition next door, so they were close by if we needed him. \r<br/>\r<br/>There is a book inside which has notes from the host and tips on how on the house works and how to locate the power box.\r<br/>\r<br/> I didn't read the part about how the power may shut  off if you have the AC and shower on at the same time as the pool motor is running. The power cut out when I was in the shower but it was quickly fixed when I went behind the house to flip the switch back on. \r<br/>\r<br/>When we were there, there were two small construction projects going on simultaneously, one in an adjacent lot and the one next to the house, but they weren't loud enough to interfere with our stay.

She was able to set us up with a motorbike as well as a poolside couples massage on the property.  I think it should be noted that Putu is not the owner, nor the person who you are communicating with through AirBnB.  That was a bit confusing for me at first.  Miryam is the owner who you will likely not meet since she does not live in Balian Beach.  \r<br/>The view from the balcony is breathtaking, and the perfect way to start your morning as you sip on coffee and eat the breakfast that you cooked in the kitchen downstairs.  The kitchen comes with all the basic necessities which is a really nice thing to have a home-cooked meal while traveling.\r<br/>There were definitely geckos living in the treehouse who we thought of as our Balian pets, along with Molly the dog who would come on to the property and sleep in the poolside bungalow at night.\r<br/>The night market is a must, and walking distance from the treehouse.  You can get a great, authentic meal for so cheap!  I ate at the noodle soup stand which came out to only 79 cents USD!!\r<br/>As for the rest..of course, the beach is beautiful, Tom's Garden cafe has a GREAT squid satay, and the Pondok Pitaya has a wonderful setup for a daily yoga class with an ocean view.\r<br/>The treehouse was one of our favorite memories of Bali & I would recommend this place to any of my friends.

The pool is fantastic and the tree house is everything you would expect for a simple life.

Off the beaten path, yet close to everything. The staff was able to help as needed. It was very comfortable.

A massage at the tip of a cliff at Gajah Mina is another must.\r<br/>\r<br/>All in all, the energy was inviting, warm and very positive.

Our hearts and souls feel pure and full after immersing ourselves onto this land, their home and the lovely village of Balian Beach. Every single thing lived up to Miryam's perfect description of their home built with nothing but love, the land is nothing short of exquisite (Mother Nature has truly blessed this land!) and every single person in the village was magic incarnated, kind, loving, and truly left a huge impression on our hearts and souls. There is nothing we do not love about vacationing here (actually living here for 10 days)... especially the sacred Bali dogs, the magic of the Moon, the perfect waves my man got to surf (only a 3 minute stroll away, including sweet + smiling mama and baby cows, awww!) and the authentic generosity and blessings bestowed upon us by our hosts and villagers that we are happy and proud to now call our FRIENDS. Our hearts are full with abundance, clarity, and peace. The Balian TreeHouse (and oh that magical oasis pool- best pool I've ever swam, floated, did handstands, meditated in- in my entire life, for reals!) truly helped us to \"reset and renew\" our spirits and souls. And the beach itself was just as healing (perfect for yoga and truly \"finding yourself\" in the sacred coves, wow) We cannot imagine spending our vacation in Bali anywhere else, ever again. Truth. Our love and light has been lit again by the warmth and love of Bali- Miryam, Mario, Putu and the beautiful community of Balian Beach. Anyone that chooses to stay here will leave with a softer heart, bigger smile, and happy soul. Eternal gratitude for this gorgeous and surreal experience M+M. We love you. The Mushroom Villa is a sacred healing spot to get you back in tune with the Cosmic Order in this life. All Love, (see you sooner than later!) Terimah Kasih, forever Bali. We are still feeling it!

We fell in love with the mushroom villa when we reached the place in late afternoon. Such a lovely place! The first floor was the bedroom with a comfortable bed and a kitchenette which was handy to whip up a simple meal (we cooked instant noodles when we were too lazy to step out of the villa). We had the air con switched on at night when we shut all the windows to keep the bugs out (understand they are attracted to lights), which kept the room cool and nice to sleep in. The upper deck had a really high ceiling that gave it a liberating spacious feel. We particularly loved the comfy seaters out on the balcony where one of it could either seat two to three people comfortably or double up as a cozy bed. This, in fact, was our favourite spot where we would sit for hours from morning till evening, reading a book or surfing away on our tablets (yup, wifi is available in the villa), and at the same time soaking in what nature offered us.. sights of dogs, cows and chickens, and coconut trees that lined the landscape and set against the backdrop of the sea; sound of the animals and rustling of leaves; and the breeze that brushed our skin softly. When night fell, we would be down to watch the DVDs that were aplenty in the house. The villa is secluded but not isolated. It was an easy five to ten minutes walk to the beach where the restaurants and cafes were. Whilst we did not have the chance to meet Miryam in person, she made arrangement to welcome us with chilled coconuts on our day of arrival :) And her housekeeper, Putu (who doesn't stay in the house), was a call away from the handset that was made available in the villa; and he appeared in his motorbike within minutes when we need his assistance. This was our first trip to Bali. It was both a unique and memorable holiday for us, and our stay in this lovely villa contributed a big part in our memories of this trip.",

Being five minutes away makes the house even more secluded. You can spend evenings on the open-air upper deck, and hear nothing but chirps. Sometimes a cow passes by, or some chickens run around on the property. It gets really wild when Molly the dog protects the land by barking at these animals ;) The village inhabitants, human and non-human, seem to share a gene which makes them super of friendly and relaxed.

The really fantastic garden and the great pool invite you to relax. From pick up at the airport to departure, everything really worked out great. Made is the house manager and took really perfect care of us and our concerns, thanks again for everything! Miryam is the owner and was always super reachable by mail or phone. If we come to Bali again, definitely go to the Treehouse! ",

The pool provides a pleasant refreshment in the sunshine. The restaurants and supermarket are a 5-minute walk away. Miryam, Mario and Putu supported us at any time with helpful tips and were very warm, loving hosts! \r<br/>A relaxed atmosphere with fantastic views, pool, massages in the house, delicious Balinese food, two exciting day trips... We will be happy to come back! Thank you Miryam and Putu! \r<br/>\r<br/>",

				"text": "We had a great time at Miryam's Mushroom Villa. \r<br/>The villa is super equipped and has everything you need during your holiday to enjoy it to the maximum. Amazing views, several relaxation zones and a great pool. Downstairs is the bedroom as well as the kitchen, upstairs you have a wonderful view including living room. The house is beautiful & tastefully decorated and you can tell that there is love in it. There is also a great music collection that brought us closer to Jimi Hendrix and some other performers. Great!\r<br/>Since there is no real address for the villa, Yeyen (an acquaintance of Miryam) picked us up, led our driver to the villa and showed us the apartment. \r<br/>A supermarket, some restaurants and the beach are within walking distance. The surroundings seem to be the original Bali, which was very nice and interesting. Quickly now, before tourism arrives here as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>Although we did not meet Miryam directly, she was always available and a very loving hostess. She always helped us with any questions. \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall, we can 100% recommend the property.",
