There is a nice coffee place just around the corner, the beach is by 3 min walking and very close there few nice restaurants. Because of that everything is so easy in balian beach.<br/>About he house I can say that it has 2 rooms, one where you can sleep, and one where you can just chill with balcony, sofa. <br/>There is also a desk and good internet connection for who need to work.<br/>I’ve also worked during my stay and it was very smooth.<br/>Not so good part about the house is the bathroom which is under the stairs, but was ok overnight <br/>We also tried massage at the location actually 2 times, and was a very nice and good massage( for that you just need to  discuss with Made and he will help you. The. menu is in the house with all types of massage.<br/>So what i can say overall is that i really recommend this place for anyone!",

The house has everything you need and the upstairs lounge area is lovely but it's all quite well-used and weather worn now. It would be nice if the bedroom area wasn't so small. The addition of a water dispenser was much appreciated since you can't drink the tap water!!<br/>The area is quiet and pretty and there's a fairly good range of restaurants for a small village but there isn't much to do beyond surfing. But if you're happy jut to relax by the pool like we were then Made's is great for that!<br/>Made was very quick to reply and to help.<br/>We thought the place was overpriced compared to other places we have stayed in Bali and given that the house could do with some updating.",

F&B within walking distance and can get spa treatments in villa.<br/>Average: Interior is starting to age. The neighboring treehouses (under the same host) that are more recent have superior designs such as open air bathrooms, outdoor kitchens, dedicated pool, and more lighting. <br/>Cons: Didn’t care for the location. Balian Beach is good for surfing but other neighborhoods have more diversity in activities. <br/><br/>Overall, recommend the property but wouldn’t return due to location.

(I would recommend it even more to those who will be spending time in the pool, as spending time in and by the pool is one of the best ways to appreciate the scenery.)<br/><br/>The driver that the host can connect you with is also incredible. He is one of the kindest people I have ever met, and will accommodate to your needs. Although it costs extra, it is totally worth it to be picked up by him, rather than a random taxi.<br/><br/>WARNING: Please do not forget that this is a treehouse! There will be small insects that naturally come in as a result of its location. They are not bothersome whatsoever, but if a few small bugs inside your space bothers you, you should look elsewhere. The bathroom is not close to that of a hotel’s. Just keep all of the realities that come with such a beautiful outdoors in mind when booking.<br/><br/>Despite this, the AC and the water dispenser work very well making it extremely comfortable. The bed is also very clean and well-kept. <br/><br/>One you are there, the restaurants are a 5-10 minute walk away. I would highly recommend Tekor, as it has excellent food and great service. <br/><br/>Always feel free to reach out to the host with any questions. He is great at responding and is of great help.",

I loved the design, the bedroom was super comfortable and the upstairs was a great way to relax, get a massage, and connect with the outdoors.<br/><br/>This treehouse is super special and really intertwines nature and the beauty of Bali. Bailan Beach is anywhere from an hour to two hours from Denpasar, Seminyak, Tabanan, Canggu, and Ubud so plan trips accordingly. There are no shopping centers, malls, Starbucks, or anything of the sort nearby! This is a great stay if you’re looking for something quiet and less touristy! It’s a local, small village experience and I loved every second of it. Great for surfing as well.<br/><br/>Made was a great host that made sure I had everything I needed. His communication was fast and he was there for anything I needed. <br/><br/>I enjoyed a brief walk to local cafes along the beach! It’s only 5 minutes away! If you want an extra fun scenery, please visit the secret cove restaurant! It’s a longer walk than the rest of the restaurants (15 minutes or so) but they served the most DELICIOUS food (the best food I EVER had in Bali) and it was a peaceful walk that was worth it. The staff were so kind and it was nice to be so close by. I  walked along the cove of the beach and it felt secluded and beautiful. Beware along the way there may be dogs (there are many dogs in Bali) that bark at you but they are not aggressive and don’t attack. <br/><br/>If I am in Bailan Beach again, I’m definitely booking here again, hands down. Enjoy Bali, everyone! ❤️",

During the 2.5-3 hour drive from Denpasar, Gusti told us about things to do, eat, and see in Balian. Check in was easy, and we were exited to see that there was a water purifier in the room for our use. The house and surrounding area were clean, and the landscaping was immaculate.  We ate at Tekor Bali, Casa Balian Cafe, Toms Garden Cafe, Secret Bay, and a small warung on the left side of the road on the way into Balian Beach. We enjoyed the Warung for lunch, but Secret Bay was a bit disappointing. Do take the walk down to watch the sunset there though! Overall, Made’s place is quiet and laid back. Just the right atmosphere to recover from jet lag and enjoy your first few days in Bali. We cannot recommend it enough.",

When we arrived at the treehouse, we were greeted by Made and were shown where to find everything we needed and more in the property.<br/><br/>The bed was extremely comfortable and we both got great sleep. The shower was lovely, and all the linens provided were clean, smelled delightful, and soft to the touch. The property and treehouse were very well kept, clean, and BEAUTIFULLY decorated. There are so many little touches added to the property, and you can see all the hard work that was put into making the treehouse what it is.<br/><br/>The pool was a great place to cool off after a long and hot day in Balian Beach, and the treehouse was just a few minutes walk from the beach and wonderful restaurants.

I have stayed in treehouses before and this is definitely not a treehouse. A better description would be “cabana”. The room was a bit dark and ”rustic”. The grounds did not look like the photos. The photos depict a lush green well maintained space. I understand it is dry season but even considering that the space didn’t seem well maintained. I would have been more satisfied with my experience if I had paid in the $50 a night price range but with a price tag of $100 my expectations were not met. In my opinion there are many beautiful places in bali and even Balian that offer better value for your money.",

				"text": "If you are thinking of booking this place, think no longer & book it before someone else does!!<br/><br/>Honestly this place was a highlight of our honeymoon, we travelled from the UK with zero accommodation booked bar this treehouse in the middle of our holiday because they were the last available dates when we’d looked months in advance while scrolling this site. We literally planned our honeymoon around this stay! And it superseded our expectations!!<br/><br/>We were running late on check in after making our journey from Gilli islands, it was gone 9pm by the time we arrived, but Made was there to help us with our bags and to check us in, he even had suggestions as to the restaurants still open if we hadn’t had dinner (which we hadn’t).<br/><br/>You share a pool with one other of their houses (the glass house, another listing) however we didn’t see one person, whenever we were in pool or on balcony we were (or felt) totally secluded. You can hear the waves from the balcony & will easily lull you to sleep if you let it.<br/><br/>Although we felt like we were the only ones there, when we had found we’d used all the ground coffee they’d supplied, a WhatsApp message to Made meant it was refilled within 5mins!! Also one of the days while enjoying pool, Made walked by and prepared us a coconut to drink that had just fallen from tree! He also made arrangements for our further travel to Ubud after we’d checked out, so if needed they are there to accommodate whatever you need.<br/><br/>All the amenities were there if you wanted to cook, however with their map of bars and restaurants a short walk away you had no reason to! They have a water machine with boiling, room temperature, and ice cold options. Brilliant idea! <br/>The air con was the best we had in Bali by a long way! The bed & pillows were so comfy, and with a soft thin quilt compared to sheets was a nice touch! <br/><br/>The decor is exactly what you see on the listing, bright colourful and quirky. Very in keeping with its surroundings can, the grounds were amazingly well kept, we spent a lot of the time saying to each other “have you seen that plant over there” ahah<br/><br/>I’ve thought really hard to critique this place and cannot for the life of me find one fault or improvement that could be done. <br/><br/>We will be back again ❤️❤️❤️❤️",

She fell asleep and I wanted to enjoy every second so I was going for a midnight swim. <br/><br/>Was more cozy sitting on the bamboo covered sunbed- taking it all in- the sounds, the warm coastal breeze and the strategically placed lights that created a resort feeling gleaming from pool. <br/><br/>Next morning we trekked down to Ocean- about 7 minute walk and passes locals- all with smiles and warm greetings. Some roosters crackling and about half way to the oceanfront there is a little pet monkey that someone owns- it's tied up to a tree so was kinda sad- glad we saw the wild ones later. <br/><br/>The waterfront area is a 7 minute walk-had a few surf shops for rentals, a few different yoga studios, a couple massage places (about $12/hr US), coffee shops and great surf beach. <br/><br/>We got a late check out and enjoyed the \"privacy\" of the pool- even ordered 6 Bintang's from same restaurant that we ate dinner and delivered within minutes and was like $3.00 beer! <br/><br/>We stayed at 7 places in 8 nights and this was one of the best.... we stayed at another Airbnb Ocean Front in Puta, At Double Six in Seminyak, A mansion in Ubud and a resort spot in Nusa Dua on last night. <br/><br/>One night wasn't enough at this place- and the Funky House next door- no one was there but if we had another couple that we could hang with for a week- it would be the perfect place.",

Bed is sooo comfy, and there’s hot water. We booked the place for 4 nights, but unfortunately only stayed for one. We had never been to Bali before, so didn’t really understand where anything is located. The Airbnb itself is a 7 min walk to a quiet black sand surfing beach. However, it is located on Balian beach which is a ways away from everything else in Bali. (about 2 hour drive from Ubud with traffic, 3-4 hours to airport). None of the excursions we booked were able to pick us up from the area, so if you’re looking to explore Bali and have a trip full of activities - this may not be the best place. However, if you’re looking for a fun private and romantic getaway, this is it! Also, the area is super safe and you can walk to plenty of restaurants.",

				"text": "Balian Beach is an exquisite vacation escape.  This is a place where you can truly unwind.  We often walked the beach and only saw a few local fisherman and a couple surfers on the waves.  There are plenty of great restaurants in easy walking distance and if you can get up early the morning, the fruit market is outstanding.  We also highly recommend Bella Spa and massage.  The space is a little quirky, but the massage is fantastic and you really can’t beat the sound of the surf in the background.  If you need to do any transport, use the recommended driver Gusti.  He is knowledgeable, friendly and very punctual.  This is a fantastic place.  We recommend both the tree house and the funky glass house (amazing outdoor first floor).  Great place all around!",

The only thing we ran into was there was heavy rain and with it the power went out for a couple hours at night, but that's expected everywhere with a storm. We were there celebrating my daughter's birthday and Made decorated beautifully with balloons and arranged a cake. He was also able to arrange for an in house massage upon arrival.

The house itself is cute and comfy, but if you’re afraid of the cutest geckos ever then maybe it’s not the place for you.

The pool is open and receives brilliant sunlight whilst is also surrounded by plenty of shade in either the Balinese hut or on a day bed under any number of trees.

				"text": "as shown in pictures. very beautiful property. Host Made is very polite & always available for help & support. <br/><br/>The tree house is amazing, pool is super good, very quiet and relaxed environment. <br/><br/>It is located near Balian beach which is best for surfers not for general tourists (unless they wish to remain in super quiet & relaxed environment). the location has local network issues, WiFi issues and there is no local market. For food one has to walk around 150-200 meters for cafes. Also there are only 3-4 cafes on the beach. <br/><br/>During night walking to the restaurants is very creepy as there are no lights and dogs come running towards you while barking. <br/><br/>Overall, we had a funtime during our honeymoon. No cellular network No wifi availability didn't bother us much, we used to use Cafe's wifi. <br/><br/>recommendations for travelers: <br/><br/>Do stock up from Alfa Mart or Any market before check-in, if you don't have personal vehicle hired. <br/><br/>The to and fro from Airport or south Bali to Balian will cost you around 10,00,000 IDR of $70. <br/><br/>There are no nearby tourist attractions, all attractions are around 1-2hrs drive. The cab costs around $70 for 2 hrs to and fro drive. The place is in West Bali. <br/><br/>Made is super awesome but he is not available all the time on the property, one has to call him, but without cellular network and wifi network it gets tricky. <br/><br/>the place is romantic & a treasure for couples/family who surf.",

Its true we don't have tourist traps, this is why we choose to live in Balian Beach. Most people come to Balian because they want to get away from all that and enjoy the natural surroundings, waterfalls, ricefields an deserted beaches :)) and just enjoy relaxing at the house and pool, good you did that too for a couple of days:)",

If you are a surfer, or want a taste of a laid back part of Bali, I would highlight recommend visiting. Made, who manages the property, was very kind and easy to work with through the whole process.<br/><br/>Gusti, the driver that the host arranged our transfers with was very nice, very informative on the ares and was very competitively priced especially vs other local guides. He went out of his way to accomodate us (even with a last minute early morning travel request) and was always on time.  I would highly recommend using him to get to and from this location!<br/><br/>All in all this place gets 5/5 stars from me!",

He was in contact with us from the moment we landed in the airport and kept in touch with our taxi driver (Gusti) and waited for us to arrive at the house (3 hours later than expected). Made truly makes this house a home and is eager to help in any way he can. He goes above and beyond to make sure that your holiday is everything you wished for. His family is equally as lovely and even surprised me with a homemade birthday cake and a present during our stay! <br/><br/>The house itself is clean (within limits of being immersed in plantlife) and offers enough space for relaxing and making the most of the grounds. Made cleaned the Treehouse daily and was available 24/7 for anything we needed. <br/>We will definitely be returning to see Made and his family again, as well as the local driver Putu, whom we highly recommend for day trips and excursions. He was a great driver and humble, offering knowledge and the history of the local attractions and culture. He is well priced and is relaxed too, which for us was exactly what we were looking for when going on a full day trip to Ubud etc. <br/>We did use the cooking facilities in the house, and made use of the night market, which has a small supermarket too for everything you need. A few locals also suggested the warungs there in the evening for food. We loved Tekor Bali (restaurant) and the staff are wonderful- the food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. <br/><br/>We have been home a few days now and are already itching to come back to this wonderful place. If you are looking for a welcoming place to stay with an abundance of relaxation and beauty then this is the place for you. ",

				"text": "Beautiful, private space close to Balian Beach - there is a 3 hour trip to the airport so make sure you leave 6+ hours to make your flight (as there are very few roads in / out)!   Honestly you need about 6 to get back to airport, just in case there are bus breakdowns in front of you.  Also travel lightly / don't bring a lot of bags.  <br/><br/>Made, Miryam and Gusti (driver) made my stay an absolute pleasure.   VERY close to the beach - I took the roundabout way of waking once, which was also beautiful and only took about 12 min.  However the \"secret\" path to the beach (immediate left as soon as you're on the road from your room) only takes 4-5 min walk as promised.  You are RIGHT near the beach.  <br/><br/>The garden, pool and treehouse were simply stunning.   Really beautiful, peaceful and serene.  They look exactly like the photos.  <br/><br/>There were some ants that found their way into the treehouse however (and I had some food around too which I wrapped up) - they really kept to themselves though and did not even come near the bed.  Really \"polite\" ants (haha) and I'm sure this is nothing that your hosts couldn't take some spray to fully eradicate.   (I didn't want a lot of bug spray so I didn't ask - AND I was able to use the excellent mosquito net to sleep bug-free, even though it wasn't high season for mosquitoes).  VERY helpful. <br/><br/>I've been to India and Costa Rica so I'm familiar with traveling in different countries where you're not going to get the \"Sands Resort\"-style of vacation (sometimes there are bugs / sometimes you have to be careful not to use too much water when you shower [though this was not a problem at the treehouse], and make sure you drink bottled water) - so this place was really beautiful, one of a kind, secluded, private and welcome to me.   They also provided a 5-gallon bottled water installation for drinking in the room.  <br/><br/>The beach was FANTASTIC - the food at the beach was really good - get a fresh coconut with a straw, hang out, surf, it's amazing.",

Not a problem in the slightest. People work in the world. It was not bothersome. Made and Miriam were so concerned with making sure my fiance and I had an exemplary stay, that they sent a duo of massage therapists to the Treehouse free of charge to make up for any disturbance we may have experienced (which was none. We aren't that picky, but we LOVED the massages all the same). Other touches made our stay a step above yje regylar.

There is a night market at the top of the road for local food and a few great beach restaurants within walking distance. Perfect place to relax and rejuvenate!  We have to also mention that Made was the highlight of our stay! He was so kind and accomodating and we know we have made a lifelong friend! He was always there to hook us up with anything we needed and even made a special gift for my husbands birthday. Made & Myriam we appreciate you both. Mahalo Nui Loa from your Maui family!!",

Made took down coconuts for us to drink and we found other tropical fruits around the garden.<br/>Our dog loved to go exploring in and around the garden. <br/><br/>The only negative to say is: There is a construction of a new bungalow just beside the house which make the experience less beautiful and more noisy. I would have loved this to be mentioned more specific and a discount in the construction period would have been in place.",

				"text": "Overall we had an enjoyable stay at the Balian treehouse. <br/><br/>Beginning with the positives, communication with Made and the owners was excellent both before and throughout the trip. All questions were quickly answered and their advice was very helpful. The owners also put us in contact with Gusti who drove us around several times during our stay. We were able to make plans and keep in contact with him using Whatsapp which was incredibly helpful. Additionally, the house and property are quite beautiful and are pictured accurately in the listing. The house is just a five minute walk from the beach and we really enjoyed the sleepy, yet tourist friendly town of Balian. <br/><br/>That said, we did experience several issues. During our stay our toilet started leaking and was unusable for several hours (however Made fixed it that day). Additionally, we never had hot water in our shower for the entire trip. I should also note that we rented both houses on the property which we shared with family members. For us, the layout was ideal; but for other travelers the two houses are quite close and I could see lack of privacy being a potential issue. Finally, all travelers should be aware the owners are building another villa next to this one (not noted in listing). During two days of our stay about six men were working on this house during the day, starting at 8 am. We found this frustrating as the construction is not picture or mentioned in the listing and this really diminished the private, serene atmosphere we expected. I highly recommend all travelers check on the status of this construction before booking.<br/><br/>Overall, we did enjoy our time here and the hosts were both friendly and helpful but travelers may want to check on the issues I mentioned.",

The space itself is comfortable and modest with everything you need, plus there is the incredible scenery and the friendly and always helpful Made. He was there anytime I had questions but gave plenty of space for comfort. Also, Gusti was available and willing to drive to any tours or to and from the airport. He has so much information and facts about the island and its culture it makes the drive very enjoyable. The house is only a few minutes walk to balian beach where you can surf(they have boards available to rent) or enjoy beautiful views and there are plenty of excellent restaurants along the way to choose any meal. I will recommend the tree house to anyone considering traveling to Bali who is interested in being away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Thank again for the incredible stay, I hope next time is longer!",

The place looks exactly like the pictures, and Made cut down coconuts everyday for us to enjoy by the pool. Couldn't recommend this place enough, if you're going to Bali, you should definitely put this place on your list. Even if to stay for a few nights then head to somewhere busier like Seminyak (which is what we did).",

Just a 3 min. walk to the ocean side - great surfing,  and also to tasty and friendly cafes.  We had couple massages (thank you sooooo much) right at the treehouse.

We arrived at night and woke up to the most beautiful peaceful and private garden. It is only a short walk to the beautiful surfers beach for breakfast / dinner and you can even use the phone in the treehouse to order takeaway!\r<br/>We were made to feel so welcome by Made who looks after the garden and the treehouse as well as his family who came to celebrate my birthday with us! We were genuinely taken back by the hospitality of the Balian people! Made couldn't have been more helpful and such fun! We loved having fresh cocunut from a tree in the garden most days!\r<br/>Finally, we had a dog called Molly who stayed us for the duration of our stay sleeping outside the treehouse and walking with us down the beach every morning for breakfast!!\r<br/>We would highly recommend the treehouse to anyone who wants a peaceful and private holiday or someone who just wants something different.

We were able to check out the new Glass House as well (you can find this posting on Made’s AirBnB page). It’s similar to the Tree House, but the best place to relax and lounge is downstairs instead of upstairs. The Glass House’s kitchen is outdoors which gives it more of a bar feel than the Tree House.

				"text": "We found this villa as it was advertised as one of the \"top 10 most desirable AirBnB listing\". The expectation was high prior to walking into the villa. The exterior of the villa is true to the listing, charming, cute hut sitting on top of the hill. The room itself felt a bit small and can do with a table/chair for sitting inside at night.\r<br/>\r<br/>The upstairs area is open and non-air conditioned, whilst we didn't use it at night due to mosquitos it is a great look out platform during the day. You can always take the fan from down stairs to up stairs on a hot day. \r<br/>\r<br/>A bit of a draw back is the bathroom/toilet area. Looking back to the listing we've realized that there isn't really a shot of the shower and toilet in the villa and it might have something to do with it is not the most appealing part of the equation - The bathroom area lives in the staircase area of the villa, being an enclosed area with small windows covered by greens it felt a bit damp and could do with better ventilation (Made will be cutting back the green). Whilst we were there we also found that the toilet is a bit crocked and leaking slightly (Myriam suggested that she will be replacing the toilet).\r<br/>\r<br/>The track to the beach/restaurants can get muddy when raining as the area's road isn't really built up but with all the developments that is going on in the area I suspect the roads will be upgraded down the track. The restaurants were great at Balian Beach and we enjoyed breakfast/lunch/dinner there.\r<br/>\r<br/>Whilst we only stayed 2 of the 3 nights booked, through communication I can feel that the Balian Tree house is being managed by a team that cares.  Myriam was quick to respond to my concerns and explained to me things they are doing/will do to address the points, I trust the villa with grow as it receives more and more positive criticism. Made is friendly and is on site from morning until around 4pm. We didn't really need his help with anything and he just worked quietly on the villa next door when we were there. \r<br/>\r<br/>All and all I think it is a great little place to enjoy the nature and sit by the pool during the day. The night life at the near by hotels/restaurants felt lively. If you are not a night thrill seeking person it can feel a bit trapped at night in the room. like everything it is probably a place for everyone but I can definitely see the charms that this little villa brings. \r<br/>\r<br/>",

We just enjoyed a couple of days in a luxury hotel in Singapore and were not yet prepared for all the overwhelming \"nature\". But that quickly changed. Friendly Gusti picked us up from the airport and showed us around the house. In the garden we were greeted by a couple of frogs, some snails and a few gecko's. They were soon to become our pets. After a good night's rest we met Made who immediately climbed a tree to get us some fresh coconuts. Many more fruits followed throughout the week. There were two small issues upon arrival and first day, but they were resolved within the hour and Myriam made sure we could relax to the max. We mostly ate at the lovely restaurants in the village or at the night market and I enjoyed a flat white from the coffee stand almost every morning. The food was very enjoyable everywhere and the people are very friendly. Also, the food is not expensive at all, causing me to eat and drink way too much. We often ended the day on the top floor looking over the garden, amazing. The tropical sounds are also a guarantee for a great night's sleep. I really found this the ideal spot to enjoy a nice holiday and find rest. Of all my vacations this is the one were I feel I returned in the most relaxed state possible.",

Your own luscious hideaway with gorgeous views just a few minutes walk from the beach.\r<br/>Balian is such a peaceful little area, the surf is great and the food is wonderful. Really ticks all the holiday boxes. \r<br/>If you are looking for a relaxing getaway far from the touristy hustle and bustle of Bali's main towns then this is what you are looking for! the villa itself has everything you need; from AC, pool, stove, fridge, DVD player to a lovely upstairs daybed where you can watch the sunrise. The caretaker, Made and his wife are such lovely people and will help you with any request, right down to collecting and cracking open a fresh coconut for you to drink!\r<br/>Unfortunately I got sick at the end of our stay, however both Made and the owner Mario were so helpful and caring, making all sorts of generous offers to assist me and my boyfriend.

It was very unclear who we were speaking with before our arrival. Miryam is the owner but she messages as if she is Made. When we arrived there was no explanation on the house, neighborhood or grounds.  Made (the gardener) is wonderful but does not speak English so the questions we had could not be answered. The power went out a few times every day (we followed others' advice to not use the shower and ac at the same time). There was construction every day next door and in front of the house. There is a house manual (one page) that is out of date. The information is incorrect, phone numbers are wrong. Given that there are some quirks to the house, it would have been helpful if at least the manual was updated. \r<br/>\r<br/>This could have been an incredible experience, however we were completely in the dark. It felt like, with the popularity of this airbnb, the owners have given up trying to make the guests feel comfortable. Hopefully this was just a fluke and the owners will give more attention to others in the future. Mario (Miryam's boyfriend) stopped by as we were leaving for the airport . He was on his way to go surfing. It would have been nice to hear from him or see him a few days earlier. We tried to contact him but the phone number we were given was incorrect. \r<br/>\r<br/>We definitely recommend this place to others if communication is improved. ",

Airbnb is an platform for adventurous people and we are not there to give 24 hour service like in a hotel..ist a private house wich you can enjoy renting. The AC problem is explained. Normaly we dont have people who leave the AC on 24 hours since (we think) its not necessary when you are on the Beach and Out. I (miryam) live and work in the Netherlands and I explained that to you when I had you on the phone, there seemed to be no problems then. Unfortunatly we have no control of the building projects in the area and we already explained it and lowered our price in case there is Some extra noise.

It's a surfers town, so the vibe is relaxed and the local people are just outstanding. Very welcoming and kind. \r<br/>\r<br/>Made was great, setting us up with an excellent masseuse for a massage on the top veranda and cutting fresh coconuts for us from the trees on the property. \r<br/>\r<br/>Gusti, who works with the host, picked us up at our hotel in Ubud and was fantastic.  \r<br/>The house works great for two people and the pool is an incredible treat on a hot day.\r<br/>\r<br/>It rained the night before we arrived, and the dirt roads leading to the treehouse were muddy and impassable by car,  so we and Gusti trekked our bags to the house. \r<br/>\r<br/>We arrived to find Made waiting for us and he a gave us a quick tour of the home. Made and two other men were working on an addition next door, so they were close by if we needed him. \r<br/>\r<br/>There is a book inside which has notes from the host and tips on how on the house works and how to locate the power box.\r<br/>\r<br/> I didn't read the part about how the power may shut  off if you have the AC and shower on at the same time as the pool motor is running. The power cut out when I was in the shower but it was quickly fixed when I went behind the house to flip the switch back on. \r<br/>\r<br/>When we were there, there were two small construction projects going on simultaneously, one in an adjacent lot and the one next to the house, but they weren't loud enough to interfere with our stay.  The host left a note saying the price was reduced due to the ongoing work. \r<br/>\r<br/>Our favorite place in the home was the top veranda, which has an outdoor speaker and a  disc of CD's, we spent the first night listening to classical music as the sun set. \r<br/>\r<br/>There is also the great quality of surrounding restaurants, and the one closest to the home, next to the coffee stand, was excellent.\r<br/>\r<br/>Be sure to bring your mosquito spray and good shoes for walking through the dirt paths and get ready to relax!

It truly is a marvelous and cute little house with a spectacular upstairs that is relaxing and wild at the same time. The ocean is visible from the second floor that overlooks the beautiful yard. <br/>Putu greeted us wonderfully when we arrived and explained everything clearly. The surrounding area is currently getting developed which did mean that it was easy to walk to several different options for restaurants. We were not surfers so we did happen to rent a scooter (organized for us by Putu at a very reasonable price!) in order to go down to Echo Beach farther East however there is a beach not too far off from the villa. <br/>It was a beautiful last three nights at this simple villa that truly communicates the wild nature of Bali. I would recommend this for any adventurous couple that loves to live in isolation and in the heart of more rural Bali away from the craziness of Kuta. ",

				"text": "Our experience at the Balian Treehouse was wonderful!  Exactly as shown in the pictures.  Putu was so incredibly friendly and accommodating.  She was able to set us up with a motorbike as well as a poolside couples massage on the property.  I think it should be noted that Putu is not the owner, nor the person who you are communicating with through AirBnB.  That was a bit confusing for me at first.  Miryam is the owner who you will likely not meet since she does not live in Balian Beach.  \r<br/>The view from the balcony is breathtaking, and the perfect way to start your morning as you sip on coffee and eat the breakfast that you cooked in the kitchen downstairs.  The kitchen comes with all the basic necessities which is a really nice thing to have a home-cooked meal while traveling.\r<br/>There were definitely geckos living in the treehouse who we thought of as our Balian pets, along with Molly the dog who would come on to the property and sleep in the poolside bungalow at night.\r<br/>The night market is a must, and walking distance from the treehouse.  You can get a great, authentic meal for so cheap!  I ate at the noodle soup stand which came out to only 79 cents USD!!\r<br/>As for the rest..of course, the beach is beautiful, Tom's Garden cafe has a GREAT squid satay, and the Pondok Pitaya has a wonderful setup for a daily yoga class with an ocean view.\r<br/>The treehouse was one of our favorite memories of Bali & I would recommend this place to any of my friends.  Thank you to Putu and Miryam!!",

She is close by too, and quick to resolve any issues that may arrive.  She helped coordinate massages for us with Elou- in our three weeks of travel in Thailand and Bali, hands down the best massage!  So we had her come back again :)  Wayan is great too if you want to do a little tour or day trip- we went to Ubud.\r<br/>\r<br/>We spent four peaceful days at the Balian Treehouse.  Everything was just as beautiful if not more than what is pictured.  The neighborhood was filled with locals, with an area near the beach geared toward travelers (mostly surfers).  You really feel like you're getting an authentic experience without missing things you are used to.  Walk 5 minutes and you're at the black sand beach, where there are plenty of happening places to eat- lots of healthy options too!  The area seems to be developing (people realized what a gem Balian is) so I recommend going now!",

Putu is a fabulous host. She included us in a temple ceremony that we longed to see. It was so special to be apart of the village and to hear the traditional Balinese music. The area is serene, quite and quaint. There are very few places to eat and drink but they all have something special about them. The pool is fantastic and the tree house is everything you would expect for a simple life. We were able to explore many of the beaches with help from our friend Solti, a sweet puppy who adopted us for our stay. <br/>The sunsets were breath taking. <br/>Make sure you have a daily massage with Elou. She came to the house and made each morning a treat.<br/>Also Ilou, is quite a fantastic hostess at the restaurant Mai Malu. She always remembered our name and greeted us with friendship and love. <br/>We will never forget our stay at the mushroom villa and we are determined to visit again. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",

Showing up to the airport with Gusti (the driver) holding a sign with our names on it was the start to a wonderful stay. His knowledge of the island and its history was very helpful and welcoming as we had asked him many questions as we made our way to the Villa.\r<br/>\r<br/>Balian Beach (and Bali in general) boasted the happiest of people, great traditional food options (with Western options available) very good prices, plenty of beaches, sunsets and great energy.\r<br/>\r<br/>As for Miryam's place...we couldn't have asked for anything  better. Off the beaten path, yet close to everything. The staff was able to help as needed. It was very comfortable. With the wonderful pool, options for napping (6 in all just on her property), close proximity to the beach and a number of eating establishments and local markets...our recurring question was, \"What do we do next; relax, swim or eat?\"\r<br/>\r<br/>To add to the excitement and experience, we were given the opportunity to attend a traditional Hindu celebration of a neighbor!\r<br/>\r<br/>Don't forget to explore the area bit... a well hidden trail along the river from the beach to the main road was fun and a remote swimming spot on the beach to the south and west accessible by stairway boasted a large carved fish in the stone cliffs that surrounded it and gave us an option for swimming and sunbathing with no one else around! A massage at the tip of a cliff at Gajah Mina is another must.\r<br/>\r<br/>All in all, the energy was inviting, warm and very positive.

Our hearts and souls feel pure and full after immersing ourselves onto this land, their home and the lovely village of Balian Beach. Every single thing lived up to Miryam's perfect description of their home built with nothing but love, the land is nothing short of exquisite (Mother Nature has truly blessed this land!) and every single person in the village was magic incarnated, kind, loving, and truly left a huge impression on our hearts and souls. There is nothing we do not love about vacationing here (actually living here for 10 days)... especially the sacred Bali dogs, the magic of the Moon, the perfect waves my man got to surf (only a 3 minute stroll away, including sweet + smiling mama and baby cows, awww!) and the authentic generosity and blessings bestowed upon us by our hosts and villagers that we are happy and proud to now call our FRIENDS. Our hearts are full with abundance, clarity, and peace. The Balian TreeHouse (and oh that magical oasis pool- best pool I've ever swam, floated, did handstands, meditated in- in my entire life, for reals!) truly helped us to \"reset and renew\" our spirits and souls. And the beach itself was just as healing (perfect for yoga and truly \"finding yourself\" in the sacred coves, wow) We cannot imagine spending our vacation in Bali anywhere else, ever again. Truth. Our love and light has been lit again by the warmth and love of Bali- Miryam, Mario, Putu and the beautiful community of Balian Beach. Anyone that chooses to stay here will leave with a softer heart, bigger smile, and happy soul. Eternal gratitude for this gorgeous and surreal experience M+M. We love you. The Mushroom Villa is a sacred healing spot to get you back in tune with the Cosmic Order in this life. All Love, (see you sooner than later!) Terimah Kasih, forever Bali. We are still feeling it!

The house is amazing, it has everything you need for a relaxing holiday and is situated in a perfect location. It takes about 3 minutes to walk to the beach but the house it is far enough away that you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. And when we felt too lazy to go to the beach we just relaxed at the pool. \r<br/>\r<br/>Putu went to so much effort to make us feel welcome and anything we needed he arranged straight away. He organised for us to have massages at the house, he arranged a scooter for us and took us on a day trip which turned out to be the highlight of our trip. He took us to a viewpoint where you can see rice fields for miles, very beautiful. Then he brought us to a monkey temple which looked like something out of Indiana Jones haha after the temple he brought us to a beautiful waterfall and on the way home we dropped into a temple that is a batcave, all in all a truly wonderful experience.  \r<br/>\r<br/>I highly recommend staying here.

We fell in love with the mushroom villa when we reached the place in late afternoon. Such a lovely place! The first floor was the bedroom with a comfortable bed and a kitchenette which was handy to whip up a simple meal (we cooked instant noodles when we were too lazy to step out of the villa). We had the air con switched on at night when we shut all the windows to keep the bugs out (understand they are attracted to lights), which kept the room cool and nice to sleep in. The upper deck had a really high ceiling that gave it a liberating spacious feel. We particularly loved the comfy seaters out on the balcony where one of it could either seat two to three people comfortably or double up as a cozy bed. This, in fact, was our favourite spot where we would sit for hours from morning till evening, reading a book or surfing away on our tablets (yup, wifi is available in the villa), and at the same time soaking in what nature offered us.. sights of dogs, cows and chickens, and coconut trees that lined the landscape and set against the backdrop of the sea; sound of the animals and rustling of leaves; and the breeze that brushed our skin softly. When night fell, we would be down to watch the DVDs that were aplenty in the house. The villa is secluded but not isolated. It was an easy five to ten minutes walk to the beach where the restaurants and cafes were. Whilst we did not have the chance to meet Miryam in person, she made arrangement to welcome us with chilled coconuts on our day of arrival :) And her housekeeper, Putu (who doesn't stay in the house), was a call away from the handset that was made available in the villa; and he appeared in his motorbike within minutes when we need his assistance. This was our first trip to Bali. It was both a unique and memorable holiday for us, and our stay in this lovely villa contributed a big part in our memories of this trip.",

It's located in a small village, which is just big enough to have a couple of tiny restaurants and some convenience stores, Miryam's house is located on a hillside and is a five minute walk from the beach and its shops. Being five minutes away makes the house even more secluded. You can spend evenings on the open-air upper deck, and hear nothing but chirps. Sometimes a cow passes by, or some chickens run around on the property. It gets really wild when Molly the dog protects the land by barking at these animals ;) The village inhabitants, human and non-human, seem to share a gene which makes them super of friendly and relaxed. Miryam is a superb host. Although she had other plans, she wanted to greet us, and decided to wait, despite our delayed arrival. Everything you need is in the house, ready for you to use.

It has a homey feeling plus the top balcony is a very good place to meditate or just while away your time.<br/><br/>Miryam gave us some welcome drinks which are 2 fresh and cold coconuts left in the fridge. The bed was quite big and she has a big collection of dvds for entertainment during the night.<br/><br/>The treehouse is near to the beach but there are only 3 restaurants within walking distance. The sunset at Balian beach is very stunning so do not forget to watch it as u have dinner or a beer at Pondok Pittaya.<br/><br/>Miryam including her caretaker Putu and the taxi driver Gusti ensured that we were picked up and sent to the airport at the right time.<br/><br/>Overall staying there was a wonderful experience, which a hotel cannot replicate.",

When we arrived, there was a musty, fashionable smell on the ground floor that made us think of the immediate departure. Only after 48 hours of continuous ventilation did the smell slowly improve. The ground floor is very dark, even with light, cycling was not easy.  The sinks in the living room and bathroom were leaking and the water ran out below. The towels were never changed in 5 days.

During the day it is wonderful in the pool, in the evening when the lights go on in the garden it becomes a fairytale! We spent the evenings on the balcony where there is a lovely lounge sofa. With a cold Bintang from the fridge.... What a rest! The house may not be the most luxurious thing there is, but it is clean and very cozy with a lovely bed. For us perfect.\r<br/>Balian is a super relaxed place, no mass tourism, fine restaurants and a night market with eateries where you can eat money for all kinds of people.

The really fantastic garden and the great pool invite you to relax. From pick up at the airport to departure, everything really worked out great. Made is the house manager and took really perfect care of us and our concerns, thanks again for everything! Miryam is the owner and was always super reachable by mail or phone. If we come to Bali again, definitely go to the Treehouse! ",

The pool provides a pleasant refreshment in the sunshine. The restaurants and supermarket are a 5-minute walk away. Miryam, Mario and Putu supported us at any time with helpful tips and were very warm, loving hosts! \r<br/>A relaxed atmosphere with fantastic views, pool, massages in the house, delicious Balinese food, two exciting day trips... We will be happy to come back! Thank you Miryam and Putu! \r<br/>\r<br/>",

				"text": "We had a great time at Miryam's Mushroom Villa. \r<br/>The villa is super equipped and has everything you need during your holiday to enjoy it to the maximum. Amazing views, several relaxation zones and a great pool. Downstairs is the bedroom as well as the kitchen, upstairs you have a wonderful view including living room. The house is beautiful & tastefully decorated and you can tell that there is love in it. There is also a great music collection that brought us closer to Jimi Hendrix and some other performers. Great!\r<br/>Since there is no real address for the villa, Yeyen (an acquaintance of Miryam) picked us up, led our driver to the villa and showed us the apartment. \r<br/>A supermarket, some restaurants and the beach are within walking distance. The surroundings seem to be the original Bali, which was very nice and interesting. Quickly now, before tourism arrives here as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>Although we did not meet Miryam directly, she was always available and a very loving hostess. She always helped us with any questions. \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall, we can 100% recommend the property.",
