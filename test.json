Great location for seeing the sites of Prague, visiting the Christmas Markets, shopping and enjoying the delicious restaurants all within walking distance to the apartment.  The rental team were extremely responsive to any questions I had prior to arrival, including arranging transportation back to Munich.  They also have compiled a wonderful Prague guide which was great to share with the rest of my family prior to visiting so we had a plan once we arrived.    Michal&Michael's team were great to work with!!"

		"comment": "Prague was exceptional and this apartment was a big factor in this experience. The beautiful views from the rooftop gave perspective of the architecture and location of the major places to see - these are easily within walking distance. Ubers are super easy to get to/ from places if pressed for time or don't want to walk 1-2 miles between venues. <br/><br/>We had a group of 8 and the apartment accommodated us well and provided great common space. Toiletries are sparse so do bring your own. The kitchen is well appointed for snacking, drinking and light cooking. The two french presses were VERY handy! The beds are very comfortable and cozy. <br/><br/>We didn't have heat for the first 36+ hours so we were chilly for a bit -  probably not a regular occurrence and eventually things got fixed (owners very communicative). The place is a tad run down with rips in the dining chairs, minor spots on sofa, rips in the hot tub cover so if that bugs you then take note. It didn't bug us at all and were minor."

		"comment": "A great apartment very well situated in the heart of Praha, big volumes, terrace and facilities are very enjoyable. The Michal&Michael team is fantastic, very professional they are always reachable and to not hesitate to help you in your request, their answer are very quick.<br/>The only little negative point would be not to have enough keys (1 or 2 sets) for 11 guest.<br/>We recommend this apartment for spending great time with friends (or big family)"

The amenities were 5 star with spacious and clean bedrooms. The rooftop terrace was the true gem to staying here. After walking several miles each day, everyone in our party couldn't wait to get back and relax in the hot tub or lounge chairs and enjoy the magical views. The staff was amazing - very responsive and professional. If you are considering this property then look no further and book now, you will not be disappointed."

The real gem is the private roof, with a jacuzzi, comfortable outdoor furniture, and an unbeatable view of some of Prague's most iconic landmarks (castle, clock tower, etc.). The location is also great, steps away from Old Town, Charles Bridge, and lots of great restaurants, bars and clubs. The apartment is on a high floor (elevator in building) so noise was never an issue. <br/><br/>The hosts were gracious enough to write up a full Prague guide that our group took full advantage of, including recommendations for restaurants, bars, coffee shops and sites to see. They were very responsive to any questions / concerns I had before we booked, and were great to deal with. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone. It truly made our experience in Prague special, and made it really convenient to tour the city. Many in my group noted that this was the best Airbnb they've every stayed in (especially because of the rooftop!). We'll be back! "

We were only there a short period of time so tried fitting in as much as possible. We had a little issue with the electrical because the power kept shorting out but after a quick phone call we were told maintenance would fix. I think this may have had something to do with the jacuzzi because as we tried to heat it the power would always cut out. We could not use it because of this. Was definitely a disappointment. One of my guests had fallen over onto a table in the loft and broke it. I had called the owner straight away to arrange a cash payment for the damages. 2 days later I received a message saying the owner had found a broken light and wanted to seek damages. We did not break the light so I told them we would not pay. I haven't had any further contact from the owner. "

Zorg voor een fatsoenlijke espresso machine, die koffiepot is het appartement niet waardig.<br/>2. Zorg voor een welkoms pakket, met Bv wat fruit, een flesje wijn of wat bier in de koelkast voor iedereen. Dat is natuurlijk veel gezelliger binnenkomen en dan voelt het nog meer af."

Schade ist jedoch das es sichtbare Wasser Eindringungen an zwei Decken in Schlaf räumen gibt, wo ebenfalls bei regen Ereigniss Wasser durch tropft. Ebenfalls zwei defekte Sonnenliegen  (von 2)auf den Roof top sowie keine funktionsfähigen Sonnenschirm. Die Überwachungskamera für den roof top Bereich muss auf jeden Fall abgehängt werden. Das geht garnicht! Alles in allem - etwas in Mitleidenschaft gezogene Unterkunft - aber für über 3000€ für zwei Nächte absolut überzogen."

		"comment": "Die Unterkunft liegt mitten in der Altstadt in Prag. Die Dachterrasse ist ein Traum. Wir hatten ein paar schöne Tage zu 6 in Prag. Allerdings sind die ein oder anderen Möbelstücke schon sehr renovierungsbedürftig bzw. müssten dringend erneuert werden. Auch die Sauberkeit ist definitiv ausbaufähig. Hinzu kam, dass wir jeden Tag mind. 1h kein Wasser hatten. In der Küche ist keine Kaffeemaschine und keine Grundausstattung wie Salz, Pfeffer und Öl vorhanden. Der Whirlpool ist extrem chlorhaltig, sodass wir uns fast alle nach 3 Tagen einen Ausschlag am Körper eingefangen haben. Eine Reisender musste sogar zum Arzt und sich eine Kortisonsalbe verschreiben lassen. Das Preis-Leistung-Verhältnis stimmt hier leider nicht und die guten Bewertungen können wir leider nicht teilen."

		"comment": "Ich hatte für ein Fotoshooting für Social Media angefragt direkt nach der Buchung, da ich 150 Euro Stornierungskosten lieber in Kauf nehmen wollte, als die scheinbar tolle Wohnung nicht zu bekommen. Dann kam von den Besitzern sofort die Frage ob es Werbung sei, nur Social Media sei ok. Ich meinte nicht direkt, aber da Social Media ja theoretisch immer Werbung sei, sollen sie mir doch gerne sagen wie die Konditionen wären, wenn wir von Werbung sprechen würden. Dann kam plötzlich keine Antwort mehr. Ich fragte am Tag danach extra nochmal nach und trotzdem kam nichts. Wir hatten dann wegen dem 'ok' zu Social Media und keiner weiteren Antwort gedacht das es dann wohl ok sei. Dann EINEN Tag vor der Anreise (nachdem wir eine Reise für 11 Personen von Aachen nach Prag geplant hatten und noch zwei weitere Locations für den selben Zweck ohne Probleme in Prag angemietet hatten) schrieb mir Jana, dass sie es dann jetzt doch als Werbung einstufen wollen und dass es dann den VIERFACHEN Preis kosten würde. Nachdem ich ihr sagte, dass das so nicht geht, da sie das viel früher hätte Kommunizieren müssen und es für uns unglaubliche Folgekosten hätte jetzt zu stornieren, redete Sie wohl mit dem Besitzer der Location und sagte es würde 'nur' 200 Euro mehr kosten. Ich finde eine solche Art unmöglich und richtig hinterlistig.<br/><br/>Zur Wohnung selbst: Lage ist toll und auf der Dachterrasse kann man es gut aushalten. Dennoch finde ich dass die Location für den Preis eher schmuddelig ist. Wir waren die Nacht vorher in Praha 4 in einem Appartement was lediglich 300 Euro teurer war und das war eine der krassesten und schönsten Apartments welches wir je gesehen haben. Dagegen wirkte diese Location umso runtergekommener und vor allem auch viel dunkler als auf den Fotos dargestellt. Also wem Geld egal ist und wer einfach Zentral wohnen will kann die Wohnung nehmen. Wer aber eine außergewöhnliche Location für seinen Aufenthalt sucht, die ihren Preis absolut wert ist, dem Rate ich eher von dieser Location ab."

Místo je překrásné, všichni si to chvalili a už jsme debatovali nad tím, ze bychom jeli znovu. Výhled je nepopsatelny stejně jako celkový design toho bytu.

Мы жили в ней две ночи. Приехали на такси и с лёгкостью нашли место. Нас встретила приятная услужливая Вероника и рекомендовала нам что посмотреть поблизости .Есть прекрасные рестораны буквально в нескольких метрах. Мы выбрали эту квартиру чтоб отпраздновать юбилей в семейном кругу. Было очень удобно добираться во все туристические места,погода была замечательная и мы проводили много времени на балконе с изумительным видом на город.Джакузи прекрасное дополнение к квартире. От туда открывается замечательный вид на замок. Мы получили  огромное удовольствие. И молодые и взрослые.<br/><br/>Квартира напоминает по дизайну галерею с очень продуманной и точной планировкой с интересными большими картинами на стенах ,которые очень понравились моей маме поклоннице   Современного искусства. Квартира очень рекомендуется семьям. Есть большой салон кухня со всеми принадлежностями удобные спальни. Оформлено все в прекрасном вкусе. Мы заказали квартиру чтоб отпраздновать день рождения мамы.был изумительный отдых все остались очень довольны. Настоящая находка!<br/>"
